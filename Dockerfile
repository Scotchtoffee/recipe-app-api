#we could create a different "RUN" command for every single line, but using a double ampersand backslash
#makes it more efficient
#creating more than one RUN creates different layers in the image we are using, and it's better
#to avoid doing it to keep our images lightweight

# "-m venv" creates a virtual environment to avoid any possible conflicts with other dependencies in other projects
# "rm -rf /tmp && \" removes the tmp (temporary) directory to avoid any extra dependencies in our Docker image
# make sure to remove temporary files as part of your build process to save as much space and speed when deploying your app
# addUSER calls the USER COMMAND, which adds a new user inside our Docker image
# and it's a good practice because if you don't specify, it will use the ROOT USER, and this user has permission to do everything on the server
# DON'T RUN YOUR APP WITH THE ROOT USER. If your app gets compromised, the attacker will have full access to the Docker container
# "ENV PATH="/py/bin:$PATH" adds /py/bin to the system PATH so that every time we run Python commands, it will run automatically from our virtual environment


# Sets dev=false so when it is used by any configuration other than the docker-compose file, it remains false so we don't run our app in dev mode.
# However, if itâ€™s used by docker-compose file, it will be overwritten to true so it will install the dev dependencies.
